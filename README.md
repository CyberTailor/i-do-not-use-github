# I Do Not Use GitHub
While you may see some commits of mine for projects related to my employer,
_I do not use GitHub for personal projects_.

**My projects can be found at https://mikegerwitz.com/projects/**, with a
mirror of some of them at https://gitlab.com/mikegerwitz.


## Why Not GitHub?
Primarily because GitHub requires users to run [non-free
JavaScript](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.en.html) to use
all features of the website.  Not only will I not do this, but I don't want
to direct users to GitHub either, because doing so is asking them to run
non-free software.

GitHub is under new ownership, so maybe there is hope to change that.

For more information, see https://mikegerwitz.com/about/githubbub.


## Why GitLab?
GitLab [has committed to licensing all client-side JavaScript under a free
license](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/05/20/gitlab-gitorious-free-software/).
Not only does this mean that I can use GitLab without running non-free
software, but it also means that I am not asking others to visit a website
that causes them to run non-free software.

GitLab also releases their Community Edition as free software, which means
that users are free to self-host using free software if they so choose.


## How do I send you PRs?
Pull requests (PRs) are not the only way to send changes to others.  In
fact, it's not even a feature of Git itself.

You have a few options:

- If your repository is published somewhere (be it this site or elsewhere),
  I can add it as a remote (using `git remote add`) and merge your changes.
- Email the patches to me.  You can prepare them using `git format-patch`.
- If the repository is on GitLab, I'll collaborate with you there.
- [Get in touch with me](https://mikegerwitz.com/about) and I'll help you
  out.
